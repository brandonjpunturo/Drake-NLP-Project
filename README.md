# Using Natural Language Processing on Drake Lyrics Analysis



This Jupyter Notebook is all of the background work done for an article I wrote for Towardsdatascience.com (Link to article: https://towardsdatascience.com/drake-using-natural-language-processing-to-understand-his-lyrics-49e54ace3662). Basically, this article uses the lyrics from the json file in this repository to perform a variety of NLP tasks. Named Entity Recognition and topic modeling are two techniques I used for this project.

## Getting Started

Will need to have Jupyter Notebooks installed. Supplementary, will need to have downloaded the JSON file in this repository.

### Prerequisites

Programming done in Python 3.

Libraries used include:
Numpy
Pandas
NLTK
Matplotlib
Seaborn
SK Learn
pyLDAvis
